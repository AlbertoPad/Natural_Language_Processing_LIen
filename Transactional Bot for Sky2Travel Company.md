# Transactional Bot for Sky2Travel Company
<p style="text-align: justify;">
This project was done in a week in March 2023 in the Master of Data Science at Assembler Institute of Technology. We were a team of four people: Helen Navarro, Sergio Salvador, Francisco √Åvila, Lien Chin.

<p style="text-align: justify;">
This project involved developing a transactional bot for managing queries and orders for the fictional company Sky2Travel. As a freelance consultant hired by the company, I was asked to perform an initial demo of the project to check the feasibility of the requirements.

<p style="text-align: justify;">
The main objective of the project was to create a bot capable of converting a user-entered phrase into a JSON file, and generating a table or JSON file with the necessary information to process the user's request and send them the information to their mobile phone along with a direct payment link.
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
To achieve this, a custom tagger was trained based on a corpus of at least 20 phrases or requests similar to those shown in the provided example. A virtual assistant that responds to the user's voice input was also created.
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
The project was organized into a document updated throughout its development, which included a description of the sources used, an XLS file showing the results of each query, a notebook with the commands used and the results, and a final conclusion summarizing what was learned during the exercise.

The established requirements were met, including the addition of comments in each code fragment, writing all comments and examples in English, and using the MySQL server class. The project files were delivered in a compressed folder and complete documentation was provided.
